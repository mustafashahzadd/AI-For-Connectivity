Objective:
Bridging the digital divide by analyzing school network performance across underdeveloped regions and providing actionable solutions to improve connectivity.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Select a country and school to analyze its connectivity metrics.
Real-Time Insights: Evaluate latency, upload speed, and download speed.
Actionable Solutions: Suggest improvements for connectivity and foster development.
üåç Problem Statement:
Many schools in low-developed countries struggle with high latency and poor network speeds, affecting productivity and national development.

üí° Solution:
Our model evaluates network metrics for over 13,000 schools across 12 countries, categorizing them as:

1. Low Development (<0.7)
2. Medium Development (0.7‚Äì0.8)
3. High Development (>0.8)
It predicts connectivity issues and suggests optimized metrics for improvement.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib.
Data Retrieval: FAISS, SentenceTransformer, NumPy.
Predictive Analytics: Groq API, Llama-3.3-70b-Versatile.
Impact:
This project empowers schools with the tools to improve their network performance, enabling better educational outcomes and fostering long-term developmen
